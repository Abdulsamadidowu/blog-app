# 📝 Vue Blog App

A lightweight and modern blog application built with **Vue.js** and **Vue Router**, focused on performance, clean UI, and scalable structure. The project demonstrates practical use of **lazy loading**, **Suspense for async components**, API data fetching, and UI enhancement with **Lucide icons**.

## 🎯 Project Initiative

This project was created to apply real-world Vue concepts such as client-side routing, asynchronous component handling, and performance optimization through code-splitting. It serves as a hands-on practice project for building scalable front-end applications that consume and display dynamic API-driven content.

## ⚙️ Core Technologies

- **Vue.js** — Reactive, component-based UI framework  
- **Vue Router** — Client-side routing and navigation  
- **Suspense** — Graceful handling of async components and loading states  
- **Lazy Loading (Dynamic Imports)** — Route-level code splitting for faster initial load  
- **Lucide Icons** — Clean and customizable SVG icons  
- **API Fetching** — Dynamic retrieval of blog data from external services  

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Modular component architecture  
- Optimized route loading for better performance  
- Clean and responsive UI design  
- Real-time data rendering from API endpoints
